# Roadmap

### Improvements

#### Migration to Aurora&#x20;

Migrating `HakoHomeVault` from Polygon to Aurora will allow Hako to scale on-chain activity and provide free transactions and swaps for Hako users.

#### MCP

We plan to migrate the Hako Admin Wallet to an MPC setup, where control is split across multiple parties and no single key is sufficient to operate it.
