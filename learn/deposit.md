# Deposit

You send stablecoins from your wallet into a Hako vault, and in return you get a vault LP token that represents your share. From that moment, Hako liquidity engine can allocate your share across different strategies and chains.&#x20;



#### 1. Choose vault, network, and token

#### 3. Approve the token

Click **Approve**, then confirm the approval transaction in your wallet. This gives the vault permission to use that token for deposits.

After approval, click **Deposit**.

Your wallet opens a transaction with the deposit details. Confirm it and wait for it to be confirmed on-chain. The app will show the transaction as pending and then completed.

#### 5. Check your position

**When the transaction is confirmed:**

* Your deposit appears as a _vault balance_ in the app.
* You now hold the vault LP token representing your share.
* Over time, the value of this position will move with the performance of the vault's strategy.
