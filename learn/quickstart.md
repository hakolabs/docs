# Quickstart

**Hako** is a DeFi earning platform and vault system. You deposit once into a vault, receive an LP token that represents your share, and Hako’s liquidity engine allocates your funds across multiple strategies and chains in the background.

### Before you begin

To use Hako you need:

1. EVM wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, Rainbow, or any wallet supported by WalletConnect)
2. Some crypto on a supported network

### Connect Wallet

Make sure your wallet is installed and unlocked, then open the Hako app and press `Connect wallet`.

Choose your wallet type (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.), approve the connection, and ensure your wallet is on a supported network.
