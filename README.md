# Introduction

**Hako** is a DeFi earning platform and vault system that automates how liquidity is allocated across chains and strategies. Instead of managing individual positions on multiple protocols and networks, users interact with a single vault, while an AI-powered liquidity engine redistributes assets on-chain in search of real yield.

Hako continuously scans the ecosystem of trusted, verified vault providers and yield pools, aggregates many opportunities, and reallocates liquidity between them. Rather than relying on one source of yield, the system maintains a diversified portfolio that can adapt as market conditions change.

**Key advantages:**

* Operates across multiple chains and strategies, not just one network or one yield source, so the vault can follow attractive opportunities wherever they appear.
* AI liquidity engine to actively rebalance between trusted, verified vault providers, aiming to keep capital allocated to higher-earning and sustainable strategies rather than passively holding one position.
* Single vault interface and LP token, while the cross-chain routing and strategy management stay inside the infrastructure, reducing the need to bridge or micromanage positions manually.
